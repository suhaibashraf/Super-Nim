# Super-Nim 

Welcome to Super-Nim, an advanced iteration of the classic Nim game. In Super-Nim, players take turns removing sticks from stacks, with the goal of being the last to take a stick. This version introduces complex strategies and AI integration, making it a challenging and educational experience for both new and seasoned players. The AI component is designed to either win or achieve a tie, presenting a formidable challenge to human opponents.

### Technology Used
* Python 
* MinMax (AI Technique)

The MinMax algorithm ensures that the AI analyzes possible moves to make the best decision at each turn, effectively learning from the game's dynamics.
